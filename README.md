For the purpose of facilitating the submission of in-game task completion screenshots, the Application is able to detect the message type and automatically forward screenshot data to server administrators.

4.2 Provision of Quality of Life Features. The Application utilizes message type detection to automatically notify users if they attempt to send a message without an attached image, optimizing the user experience.
